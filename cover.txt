mm: memcg: merge page_counter trees

This patchset reorganizes page_counter structures which helps to make
memory cgroup and hugetlb cgroup structures smaller (10%-35% depending
on the kernel configuration) and more cache-effective. It also eliminates
useless tracking of protected memory usage when it's not needed.

v2:
  - two page_counter structures per hugetlb cgroup instead of one
  - rebased to the current mm branch
  - many minor fixes and improvements
v1:
