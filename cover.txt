mm: memcg: put cgroup v1-specific memcg data under CONFIG_MEMCG_V1

This patchset puts all cgroup v1's members of struct mem_cgroup,
struct mem_cgroup_per_node and struct task_struct under
the CONFIG_MEMCG_V1 config option. If cgroup v1 support is not
required (and it's true for many cgroup users these days), it
allows to save a bit of memory and compile out some code, some
of which is on relatively hot paths. It also structures the code
a bit better by grouping cgroup v1-specific stuff in one place.
