mm: memcg: separate legacy cgroup v1 code and put under config option

Cgroups v2 have been around for a while and many users have fully adopted them,
so they never use cgroups v1 features and functionality. Yet they have to "pay"
for the cgroup v1 support anyway:
1) the kernel binary contains an unused cgroup v1 code,
2) some code paths have additional checks which are not needed,
3) some common structures like task_struct and mem_cgroup contain unused
   cgroup v1-specific members.

Cgroup v1's memory controller has a number of features that are not supported
by cgroup v2 and their implementation is pretty much self contained.
Most notably, these features are: soft limit reclaim, oom handling in userspace,
complicated event notification system, charge migration. Cgroup v1-specific code
in memcontrol.c is close to 4k lines in size and it's intervened with generic
and cgroup v2-specific code. It's a burden on developers and maintainers.

This patchset aims to solve these problems by:
1) moving cgroup v1-specific memcg code to the new mm/memcontrol-v1.c file,
2) putting definitions shared by memcontrol.c and memcontrol-v1.c into the
   mm/memcontrol-v1.h header,
3) introducing the CONFIG_MEMCG_V1 config option, turned off by default,
4) making memcontrol-v1.c to compile only if CONFIG_MEMCG_V1 is set.

If CONFIG_MEMCG_V1 is not set, cgroup v1 memory controller is still available
for mounting, however no memory-specific control knobs are present.

v1:
  - switched to CONFIG_MEMCG_V1 being off by default based on LSFMMBPF
    discussion [1]
  - switched to memcg1_ prefix (Johannes)
  - many minor fixes
  - dropped patches which put struct memcg members under CONFIG_MEMCG_V1
    (will post as a separate patchset)
